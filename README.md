# JavaScript Calculator
## Goal:
This project is a personal challenge of mine, which serves as a reference for software development newbies enquiring how to create basic calculators using the languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
However, I challenge anyone to develop their own and more elaborated version :smile:.
Not only this enhanced my problem solving in JavaScript but also provided an opportunity to personalise my page by combining various tools to design the art work.

- **Core Functions:**
    - Clear Screen
    - Display Number
    - Display Total
    - Warning / Error messages
    - Operations:
        1. Add
        2. Substract
        3. Multiply
        4. Divide


**What skills are developed through this project?:** Clean code writing, algorithms, problem solving, testing, front-end design, agile methodology, project management, git version control and GitHub.

## How to run:
Languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Text Editor: e.g., Visual Studio Code
Live Server

## Credits:
This is a good starting point for understanding *one of the many ways* on how to approach the problem.
